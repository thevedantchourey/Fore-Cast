Fore-Cast

This my first Android Project using weather REST API.
Fore°Cast is an amazing weather app that uses the Weather REST API to forecast weather reports for any location in the world. With Weather REST, you can:

Get the current weather conditions, such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and pressure, for any city or town in the world. Save your favorite locations and access them quickly and easily. Share your weather reports with your friends and family via social media, email, or SMS. Fore°Cast is the ultimate weather app for travelers, adventurers, planners, and anyone who wants to stay informed and prepared for any weather situation.
